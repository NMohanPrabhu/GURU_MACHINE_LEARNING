    "Tomek Links is a technique used to clean up a dataset by removing ambiguous or borderline samples between the minority and majority classes. It is an under-sampling method that aims to improve class separability by identifying pairs of nearest neighbors from different classes and removing the majority class samples from these pairs. This helps to clean the decision boundary by eliminating noisy or borderline instances that might cause confusion for classifiers."
